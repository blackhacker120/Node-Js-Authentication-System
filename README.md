I have developed a powerful authentication system in Node.js using Express.js. The system includes a robust user registration process and a secure login functionality. Working closely with John Makweba, we have implemented stringent security measures to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. The system integrates advanced password encryption and secure session management for maximum protection against potential threats.
